# ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript: Building Web Apps with Frameworks

This session will explore how you can build custom web mapping experiences using ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript web components and your preferred developer environment; whether you are using vanilla JavaScript, or frameworks like React or Vue. We’ll cover the unidirectional data flow in React, how to use and develop your own custom hooks, use composition and conditional rendering to develop powerful web apps. You’ll also learn about layout capabilities with map components and Calcite Design System, and techniques for creating a custom user interface.
